He went down the chute just now,
a paper towel for his shroud
and a big Premium cracker box
for a coffin. He had taken care
to come out from behind the oven
and die in plain sight. But
(a good feminist may ask) why
do I suppose he was a boy-mouse?
Might not the corpse as likely have been
a girl's? Well, I checked his genetalia
and he had the cutest little pecker
that ever incited a mouse to acts of love.

Why I Must Die: a Film Script
We had had many pre-death services
already with scraps of chewy food
and 5-liter boxes of vin merde
and rations of that scarcest commodity
free speech, precious now almost
as gas, as tears They drill holes
in the storage tanks to get to it
It gushes out like living sperm
a great white awakening Think of the moment
in The Matrix when one realizes we
are the sleeping prisoners
of giant spiders from outer space
whose ships fill our skies like angelic guards
patrolling the border between the horror
of Texas and the horror of Babylon
for not all that much has changed since Then
fire still burns water still drowns
except now it's not just the Euphrates
it's all the rivers that are rising
and the seas Will the soil still be arable
once Carthage is deleted? Will we be able
to eat the tomatoes? But hush!
I see a snitch Follow me into the sewer
We'll be safe underground

The Tablets of Common Knowledge 2
People regularly disappear.
Some simply return to the burrows
they've lived in and die among friends.
Some take holidays: you may have received
their postcards and seashells. But many more
are murdered. The numbers are astonishing.
Corpses disintegrate in woodland graves
or, submerged, are home
to the seaworm and the ray.
We are entering an era
when men will die like flies,
swept off by floods, shoved
into pits by bulldozers, or starving
en masse as they cling
to the prison bars. Oh, the world
is a terrible, unkind place. But wasn't that
always the case? Let's sing something
together. Maybe that will help.

The Tablets of Common Knowledge 1
Two of them appeared in a perp-walk
on Channel One tonight, looking tough and stoic--
but still young enough to serve as someone's
bitch once they've been bled by their lawyers
and whoever may be able to spare them, a while,
the horrors of an enforced sodomy. That.
as we know, is what prison is there for
and that is why there is an interval
between the sentencing and the first rape.
Kill yourselves while you can, guys.
It's what I would do.

No Island is an Island either
but each with its Beaches and its Groves
is a Ship that went aground amid the Reefs
that surround it and now a part of the whole
Global Community whose miserable proles
spend their long work-days toiling
at knitting machines cleverer than they are.
It's not as though if they were that bit
more clever they might escape to an Island
somewhere the Sea would not soon
engulf them again. We are all sinking
together, the Ships, the Crews, the Islands.
Solidarity forever. That's the News.

Tears the Bullet Wept

We know that bullets sing.
Bret Harte transcribed their song.
But give them this: they weep as well,
And theirs are the most precious souvenirs
That venders hawk on the streets of hell.

What is so tragic as the lethal blast
Of thunderbolt or .38
That turns what had been present
Into past? There he stood
And here he lies at last.
Will you not shed a single tear
For any such? Is that too much to ask?

Here is a tear. Weigh it,
Please, Sir, on your scale--
And I will tell you the whole tale.
But only when your job is done.
Kill all the rest first. I will wait.

             All woodlands are haunted
            for that is where we usually kill
           our victims.  Animals are just the same
            as us.  They leave the carcasses  
             of half-eaten prey beside popular  
              waterholes as your mother may
           leave choice leftovers in the fridge.

             I have the skull of a feral cat
             I found in the cleft of an oak--
               picked clean.  Woodland ghosts 
               become feral themselves and prance
                 about like water bugs, grimacing
                 wildly.  When you see one,
             grimace back, and if you're feeling
             some keen despair, as one often does,
                take off your clothes and dance
                with them.

                            But beware!
                            it is their aim
             to dance with you until you're dead
             from just the rapture of the dance
             as Hilarion dies in Giselle.

                                           Visit
             any forest on Midsummer's Eve
             and hide your clothes inside
             some rotted log as an invitation
             to the fairies' murderers.  
                                       Close your eyes     
                                    and they will come to you,
                                pretending to be mosquitoes.
                          Follow them to where they've left   
                 their earlier victims and lie upon that heap.

             Is there any zephyr sweet as these?
             Eat the mushrooms round about.
             Prick a vein and sip the blood.
             Soon you will have passed beyond
             the realm of breath, a companion of
             the curious insects and
