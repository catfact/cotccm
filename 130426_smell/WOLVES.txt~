(Was all in vain? Or did you cry? No need to ask, my tears have run dry This is the end of my pity I await to die You now the living, me now the dead To prove that you loved me Mere words could not have said Bitting into skin, into flesh, into me Taking all you could Oh, I'd still give you blood Just to paint your lips 

 If you should wish them red My desires your kiss completed But only now I can see The vicious joy when you took delight Behind each kiss your poison bite And when my all was given And you had taken Oh dog-like Judas You did disappear Was all in vain? Or did you cry? No need to ask You now the living, me now the dead
