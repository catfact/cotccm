2.	fade in new grains, pitch ratio 13/9 and 9/13. \

	4/3 grain (cadential)\
	slider pitch grains around, pitch grain 1 moves to eg 22/9 and 1/2\

	cadence to fifths, full shaper, new grain at high octave.\

3.	loudest point.\
	viola enters unnoticed.\
	fade in viola grains:\
	low, resonant filters, spasmodically synchronized, slow trigger\
	\
	octave grains lose linkage and begin to drift.\

	2nd cadential harmony enters \
	\
	resonance increases\

	2nd cadence\
	\
	input ends\
	\
	grains move at random and die with feedback.\
