this is a repository containing all of my Supercollider patches for live performance since 2009. 
it exists mainly for my own convenience (in case my computer sneaks out of a motel room or is smashed to pieces in a drunken rage), and not because i expect it to be useful to others. the code is written very fast, is not effecient or organized, and does not represent any kind of acceptable practice.

anyways, if you want to attempt to run anything here you must install my SC extension classes in the "catfact" repository.
you must also have sc3-plugins installed for some UGens.
older patches might be Mac only for some GUI classes, but newer ones were made on linux and should be fairly cross-platform.

if you're not familiar with Supercollider, this is a bad place to start, but i highly recommend installing it and working through some of the many fine tutorials available at http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/

thanks!
